Hello!

This is Joey Cross here. I am a historian of ancient literature. My research interests in particular are the literature of storytelling, both its poetics and its socio-cultural setting. Concretely, I am interested in novellas and other prose fiction in the Achaemenian and Hellenistic eastern Mediterranean, especially Judean and Egyptian, and in reconstructing their associated cultures of reading. More generally, I am interested in developing narratological and other critical approaches to storytelling literature from antiquity. I am also interested in interactions between Ancient Egyptian and Levantine culture, especially in Northwest Semitic texts found in Egyptian inscriptions and documents, in the Egyptian backgrounds of the Hebrew Bible, and in comparative philology of Egyptian and Northwest Semitic.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the European Research Council-funded project [From Texts to Literature: Demotic Egyptian Papyri and the Formation of the Hebrew Bible (DEMBIB)](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/stellen/gi/ERC%20Grant/ERC%20Grant) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I trained as a biblical scholar (Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) and Egyptologist at the University of Chicago, Department of Near Eastern Languages, as a student of Robert Ritner and Dennis Pardee. I received my PhD in 2022. My dissertation was entitled “The Poetics of Plot in the Egyptian and Judean Novella.” 

Previously, I was a Public Outreach and Content Specialist for the Education Department of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago from 2015-2020, where I taught continuing education courses, gave public lectures on the Ancient Near East throughout the Chicago area, and provided expertise for the museum’s docent program. Additionally, I conducted research for the [Chicago Demotic Dictionary](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/demotic-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago) and for the [Critical Editions for Digital Analysis and Research project](https://voices.uchicago.edu/cedar/) at the Oriental Institute. From 2016-2018, I taught in the Writing Program at the University of Chicago and won the Karen Dinal Memorial Award. From 2018-2020, at the University of North Carolina Asheville, I taught Latin in the Dept. of Classics and The Ancient World in the Humanities Program.
