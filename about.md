Hello!

This is Joey Cross here. I am a historian of ancient Middle Eastern and North African literature, with a particular interest in the literature of storytelling. My areas of expertise are Demotic literature, novellas of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, and historical narratology.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the ERC-funded project [From Texts to Literature: Demotic Egyptian Papyri and the Formation of the Hebrew Bible (DEMBIB)](https://www.theologie.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/stellen/gi/ERC%20Grant/ERC%20Grant) at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin. I received my PhD in 2022 from the University of Chicago, [Dept. of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations](https://nelc.uchicago.edu), in the fields of Egyptology and Hebrew Bible. My dissertation was entitled ["The Poetics of Plot in the Egyptian and Judean Novella."](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/3672?ln=en)

2016-2018, I taught in the Writing Program at the University of Chicago and won the Karen Dinal Memorial Award. From 2018-2020, at the University of North Carolina Asheville, I taught Latin in the Dept. of Classics and The Ancient World in the Humanities Program. I also held various research and education positions at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago from 2015-2020.
