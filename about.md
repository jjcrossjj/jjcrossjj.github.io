I am a PhD candidate in the [Dept. of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations](https://nelc.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, in the fields of Egyptology and Hebrew Bible. I am a historian and critic of literature, with a particular interest in the literature of storytelling, Demotic literature, and novellas of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

My dissertation is entitled "The Poetics of Plot in the Egyptian and Judean Novellas." I am currently undergoing final revisions, and will defend in February 2022.

From 2016-2018, I taught in the Writing Program at the University of Chicago and won the Karen Dinal Memorial Award. From 2018-2020, at the University of North Carolina Asheville, I taught Latin in the Dept. of Classics and The Ancient World in the Humanities Program. I also occasionally teach adult education courses at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, on topics in biblical studies and the history and archaeology of the Levant.

I grew up in Lafayette, LA, and have lived in Texas, Illinois, and North Carolina. Currently, I live in Kill Devil Hills, NC with my wife Theresa and our three children.
